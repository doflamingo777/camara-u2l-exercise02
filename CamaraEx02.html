				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>Hi, I'm Joenzsen Jonner H. Camara. I'm a passionate Softawre Engineer with a strong background in all Fields of Computer Science. I have always been fascinated by how computers work which led me to prioritize entering UPLB with BSCS as my program.</p>
				<p>Despite having an outstanding record in UPLB, I still pursue to learn more about what Computer Science really is, I believe that growth stops when aggresive-arrogance takes over.</p>
				<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing Online Video Games with my friends. I also think about how certain games are codedd, not only does it exercises my critical thinking, it also gives me creative ideas on my next coding exers or sessions.</p>
				<p>For more hardcore coding lessons that will give you a 7-digit salary, feel free to contact my anytime!</p>
