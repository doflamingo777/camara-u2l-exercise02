- Steps on how to create your own Github page:


    1. Create your own repository
    2. On the menu bar, go to `Settings -> Pages`
    3. Under `Build and deployment` -> `Source`, select `Deploy for Branch`
    4. Under `Branch`, select `main` or `root` folder then `Save`
    5. Wait for a few minutes then restart your Github, under the `Settings -> Pages` sectiom, there should be a clickable link which redirects you to your Github page.

    

- For this exer, `HTML` and `CSS` really gives you the freedom to edit and customize your website. There are also existing packages or imports that you can further explore. And since it really gives you the freedom to customize, you need to be very specific when it comes to using built-in functions from HTML and CSS. Another thing that confuses me is that sometimes, my code doesn't take effect even tough I expect it that it should, one solution I found is to add a display-background on everything, this way you can identify the margins and paddings on every element of each code.
